I am currently working on a research paper for school, focusing on the development of a Radon detector. As part of my project, I will be documenting the code used for the web server in this GitHub repository. Additionally, my friends will be responsible for documenting the code related to the Android app, which can be found at https://github.com/Onuphrius/Radon/. Also you can find the microcontroller code at https://github.com/Qwert512/Geiger_esp/.
