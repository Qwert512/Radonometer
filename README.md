I am currently working on a research paper for school, focusing on the development of a Radon detector. As part of my project, I will be documenting the code used for the web server and microcontroller in a GitHub repository. Additionally, my friends will be responsible for documenting the code related to the Android app, which can be found at https://github.com/Onuphrius/Radon/.
